Hello there! 

Hmm how much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood? These are the important questions in life ... Next to Quantum Entanglement and Black/Brown-outs.

I went to Warped Tour this summer in Charlotte and it was absolutely amazing. Couldn't hear for the next week but hey that's life. 
Saw 16 bands over a span of 9 hours. It was pretty hype.
